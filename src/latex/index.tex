\subsection*{Documentation and Game Overview}

Here you will find documentation on the game Breakout, created for the individual project assignment for C\-S\-C\-I 3081\-W. The objective of the game is to break all the bricks in the game, displayed as a beautiful rainbow at the top half of the screen. A ball bounces back and forth around the environment and destroys any bricks it comes in contact with, and the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen to bounce the ball back up towards the bricks. Instructions on how to control the paddle and pause the game are displayed in the \char`\"{}\-Controls\char`\"{} window when the game is run. If the ball passes below the paddle and hits the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life. Popularized by the Activision's 2014 hit \char`\"{}\-Call of Duty\-: Advanced Warfare\char`\"{}, the option to press \char`\"{}\-F\char`\"{} to pay respects is available when the player loses a life. The player gets three total lives to complete the objective and break all the bricks. If the player loses all three lives before breaking all the bricks, it's game over.
